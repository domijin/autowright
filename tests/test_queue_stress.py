"""§6 firing-queue + maxParallel race hunt: many threads of manual starts,
message firings, cancels, and drains against the real Engine + Store.

Hammers one automation from many threads at once — manual starts, message
firings (mixed senders), cancels, drains — then asserts the invariants the
spec promises:
  - never more than maxParallel executions live at any instant
  - the queue never exceeds maxQueued
  - every firing produced exactly one record, admission to finish
  - at the end everything is terminal, _live is empty, engine._live is empty
  - every record's status is a legal terminal status with consistent fields
